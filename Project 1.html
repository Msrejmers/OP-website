                <div>This Project is about me but without using any words that would describe me. Instead I used
                    patterns, colours and shapes that would describe me the best.
                    This Picture is a picture that whenever you look at it again, you are able to find little “Easter
                    eggs” about me as a person, for example in the Background.

                    <div>The program that I used for this Project is Procreate on an Ipad Pro using an Apple Pencil. At
                        first, I did an outline of myself and of the
                        things that I am known for. I am known for always wearing different types of glasses, always
                        wearing jewelry, having my Nails and eyebrows done.
                        I added my birthmarks to the picture as these are unique. I experimented with different colours
                        but when doing the Background, the colours did
                        not match and it took too much focus away from the background.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!--Adding another Flexbox to add more rows inside of the colums for the text and the picture to be next to each other-->
                <div class="flex-container">

                        <img src="Nintendo Background.PNG" width="2500px">
                    </div>

                    <div>The Background is a pattern that has little elements that I enjoy. There is an ongoing pattern
                        with branches and leaves,
                        this pattern is a tattoo that I would like to get in the future. This is because every leaf
                        would represent a part of my
                        life that I have experienced. There are also a few smilies, hearts and also the logo of Zelda,
                        which is one of my favorite Video games,
                        and also the logo for Nintendo, as this is my favorite console to play on. There are also a few
                        Initials of people that mean the
                        most to me, ie. My family or my best friends.

                    <div>I chose to do a pattern for the background, because I enjoy creating and looking at patterns as
                        they are fascinating and very pleasing to look at.
