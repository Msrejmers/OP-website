                <div>This project was specially made for my little sister, as a little part of her graduation present.
                    She told me she was a big fan of the “GOOD evening” painting, which is why I wanted to make one
                    personally for her.
                </div>

                <!--Adding another Flexbox to add more rows inside of the colums for the text and the picture to be next to each other-->
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div>
                        <!--Image of Projects-->
                        <img src="T Picture.PNG" width="2500px">
                    </div>

                    <div>At first, I chose the picture that I wanted to trace, however I did not only want to just trace
                        it I wanted to add my own personal touch to it.
                        Because I am such a big fan of patterns and shapes, I decided to turn my facial features into
                        triangles and fill them out with the the corresponding
                        colour that was in the original picture. I did this because otherwise you would not notice that
                        it was me, nor that it was a face.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!--Adding another Flexbox to add more rows inside of the colums for the text and the picture to be next to each other-->
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div>
                        <!--Image of Projects-->
                        <img src="T side.PNG" width="2500px">
                    </div>
                    <div>Next up, I had to chose a colour for the background. This was easy as I chose her favourite
                        colour, which is pastel rosé.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!--Adding another Flexbox to add more rows inside of the colums for the text and the picture to be next to each other-->
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div>
                        <!--Image of Projects-->
                        <img src="STUF font.PNG" width="1000px">
                    </div>

                    <div>At last, I added the text “STFU” (shut the f*** up). This is one of our little insiders, as
                        this was something that she said very often to me when
                        I was disturbing her while she was trying to study. For the font I choose Times New Roman, as
                        this was the font that she had to use for her assignments and her exams.
