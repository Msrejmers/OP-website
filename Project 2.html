            <div class=flex-container2>
                <div>The idea behind this Project was that I wanted to have a personalised hoody with my own drawing.
                    The program that I used was Procreate.

                <!--Adding another Flexbox to add more rows inside of the colums for the text and the picture to be next to each other-->
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div>
                        <!--Image of Projects-->
                        <img src="Misha close.PNG" width="2500px">
                    </div>

                    <div>At first, I chose the picture that I wanted to trace, however I did not only want to just trace
                        it I wanted to add my own personal touch to it.
                        Because I am such a big fan of patterns and shapes, I decided to turn my facial features into
                        triangles and fill them out with the the corresponding
                        colour that was in the original picture. I did this because otherwise you would not notice that
                        it was me, nor that it was a face.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!--Adding another Flexbox to add more rows inside of the colums for the text and the picture to be next to each other-->
                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div>
                        <!--Image of Projects-->
                        <img src="GOOD evening.PNG" width="2500px">
                    </div>

                    <div>As this was meant for a hoody I thought that only having a face would look too empty. Which is
                        why I added some text. I was experimenting with different
                        types of fonts and brush sizes that were available on the program. In the end I chose to do two
                        different fonts, colours and brushes. I wanted to have a
                        contrast between both of these words. I came up with “Good evening” because when I was done with
                        the end result it was evening and at that point my
                        mother came into my room and said exactly that.

                    </div>
                    <div>I chose to implement some of my younger self into this drawing and because I was very into neon
                        and bright colours I chose to use a neon-yellow for the background.
